Until now, considerable effort has been made to determine structural brain characteristics
related to exceptionalmultilingual skills. However, at least one important question has not yet
been satisfactorily addressed in the previous literature, namely whether and to which extent
the processing demands upon cognitive, linguistic, and articulatory functions may promote
greymatter plasticity in the adult multilingual brain. Based on the premise that simultaneous
interpretation is a highly demanding linguistic task that places strong demands on executive
and articulatory functions, here we compared grey matter volumes between professional
simultaneous interpreters (SI) and multilingual control subjects. Thereby, we focused on a
specific set of a-priori defined bilateral brain regions that have previously been shown to
support neurocognitional aspects of language control and linguistic functions in the multi-
lingual brain. These regions are the cingulate gyrus, caudate nucleus, frontal operculum (pars
triangularis andopercularis), inferior parietal lobe (IPL) (supramarginal andangular gyrus), and
the insula. As a main result, we found reduced grey matter volumes in professional SI,
compared to multilingual controls, in the left middle-anterior cingulate gyrus, bilateral pars
triangularis, left pars opercularis, bilateral middle part of the insula, and in the left supra-
marginal gyrus (SMG). Interestingly, grey matter volume in left pars triangularis, right pars
opercularis, middle-anterior cingulate gyrus, and in the bilateral caudate nucleus was nega-
tively correlated with the cumulative number of interpreting hours. Hence, we provide first
evidence foranexpertise-relatedgreymatterarchitecture thatmay reflecta compositeofbrain

1. Introduction
Bilinguals often outperform monolinguals in a variety of lin-
guistic and non-linguistic tasks relying on different cognitive
functions such as attention (Bialystok, Craik, Klein, &
Viswanathan, 2004; Costa, Hernandez, & Sebastian-Galles,
2008), inhibition (Bialystok et al., 2004; Festman, Rodriguez-
Fornells, & Munte, 2010), working memory (Morales, Calvo,
& Bialystok, 2013), or set shifting (Festman & Münte, 2013).
According to current knowledge, it is assumed that such
behavioural advantages origin, at least in part, from the pro-
cessing demands upon cognitive control mechanisms that are
required for solving interactions between first language (L1)
and second language (L2) during language production (Zou,
Abutalebi, et al., 2012), selecting the language in use
(Abutalebi et al., 2013; Luk, Green, Abutalebi, & Grady, 2012;
Rodriguez-Fornells, Balaguer, Munte, 2006; Rodriguez-
Fornells, Rotte, Heinze, Nosselt, & Munte, 2002), switching
between languages (Garbin et al., 2011; Price, 2012; Quaresima,
Colier, Van der Sluijs, Menssen, & Ferrari, 2001), producing
words in the weaker-spoken language (Abutalebi et al., 2013;
Hernandez, Martinez, & Kohnert, 2000), accomplishing
translation (Price, Green, & von Studnitz, 1999; Quaresima
et al., 2001) and interpreting tasks (Rinne et al., 2000), and
for inhibiting the non-target language during speech produc-
tion (Rodriguez-Fornells et al., 2002) as well.
In an extensive review of previous neuroimaging data,
Abutalebi and Green (Abutalebi & Green, 2007) have described
a set of neural devices that participate in regulating cognitive
control and language production in the multilingual brain.
These brain regions are the inferior frontal cortex, middle-
anterior cingulate gyrus, caudate nucleus, and the inferior
parietal lobe (IPL). The inferior frontal cortex is engaged in
attention, inhibition, working memory (Fuster, 2001; Hickok,
2009; Rodriguez-Fornells et al., 2006) as well as in linguistic
functions (Fiebach, Schlesewsky, Lohmann, von Cramon, &
Friederici, 2005; Friederici, 2006; Friederici & Gierhan, 2013),
whereas the middle-anterior cingulate gyrus is implicated in
monitoring the language in use, allocating attention, conflict
monitoring, and error detection (Abutalebi & Green, 2007;
Hernandez, 2009). Notably, previous functional (Crinion
et al., 2006), structural (Zou, Ding, Abutalebi, Shu, & Peng,
2012), and lesion (Abutalebi, Miozzo, & Cappa, 2000) studies
have identified the caudate nuclei as being part of a neuronal
network that contributes to language selection and switching
mechanisms. In addition, previous work has shown that the
IPL [i.e., angular and supramarginal gyrus (SMG)] can be
structurally altered in bilinguals compared to monolinguals
(Della Rosa et al., 2013; Mechelli et al., 2004), and that grey
matter in this brain region correlates with L2 proficiency, age
of L2 acquisition (Mechelli et al., 2004), or even with other
biographical measures (Della Rosa et al., 2013). The IPL is
involved in mediating attention (Elmer, Meyer, Marrama, &
Jancke, 2011; Kiehl et al., 2005) and working memory func-
tions (Buchsbaum, Olsen, Koch, & Berman, 2005; Hickok,
2009), and in mapping a sound’s structure to its phonetic
representation (Golestani & Zatorre, 2004; Ruff, Marie, Celsis,
Cardebat, & Demonet, 2003; Turkeltaub & Coslett, 2010).
Evidently, depending on the cognitive requirements necessary
for accomplishing a particular language task (for example
translation versus sentence repetition), and on the degree of
speech competence achieved by the speaker, the single
neuronal devices of the cognitive control system are differ-
entially engaged (Elmer, 2013).
Beside the undisputed contribution of cognitive control
functions to multilingual speech processing [for an overview
consider (Abutalebi & Green, 2007; Rodriguez-Fornells et al.,
2006)], there is currently likewise evidence indicating that
multilingual speech competence and expertise are associated
with functional and structural changes in brain regions sup-
porting articulation and sensory-to-motor coupling mecha-
nisms, namely in the basal ganglia (i.e., caudate nucleus)
(Abutalebi et al., 2008; Eickhoff, Heim, Zilles, & Amunts, 2009;
Zou, Ding, et al., 2012) and in the left middle-anterior insula
(Elmer, Hänggi, Meyer, & Jancke, 2011; Golestani, Molko,
Dehaene, LeBihan, & Pallier, 2007; Golestani & Pallier, 2007).
Such neuroplastic changes are supposed to arise as a conse-
quence of the processing demands that are necessary for
continuously adjusting the motor output while speaking (as a
function of auditory feedback), this being a prerequisite for
achieving a best possible pronunciation. In this context,
Golestani and Pallier (Golestani & Pallier, 2007) reported that
French speaking subjects who more accurately learnt to pro-
nounce a Persian consonant that does not exist in French
showed increased white matter volume in the left anterior
insula. However, although the left anterior insula has repeat-
edly been identified as being crucial for articulation, phonation
(Ackermann & Riecker, 2010; Baldo, Wilkins, Ogar, Willock, &
Dronkers, 2011; Kurth, Zilles, Fox, Laird, & Eickhoff, 2010) and
sensory-to-motor coupling mechanisms (Mutschler et al.,
2007, 2009), this heterogeneous brain area participates in a
variety of other brain functions (i.e., non-motor) aswell (Flynn,
Benson, & Ardila, 1999; Sterzer & Kleinschmidt, 2010).
Up to now, the majority of studies that have addressed
functional and structural neuroplasticity, executive language
control, and linguistic functions in themultilingual brain have
focused on comparisons between bilinguals and mono-
linguals (Abutalebi et al., 2013, 2012; Zou, Abutalebi, et al.,
2012; Zou, Ding, et al., 2012), bilinguals with high and low
proficiency (Abutalebi et al., 2013), or even on bilinguals acting
in both monolingual and bilingual contexts (Abutalebi et al.,
2008). These previous studies have indisputably contributed
to a better understanding of the brain regions supporting ex-
ecutive language control in themultilingual brain. However, it
still remains unclear whether these brain regions are sus-
ceptible to structural changes as a function of training in early
adulthood. Therefore, the investigation of professional
simultaneous interpreters (SI) may constitute a fruitful and
complementary approach for better understanding plastic
adaptations in the adult brain in regions administrating
cognitive control, linguistic functions, articulation, and
sensory-to-motor coupling mechanisms [(Elmer, Hänggi,
et al., 2011; Elmer, Meyer, & Jancke, 2010; Elmer, Meyer,
et al., 2011), for a review consider (Elmer, 2013)]. This is
related to the fact that simultaneous interpretation is trained
as recently as in adulthood, and places heavier demands upon
cognitive, linguistic, and articulatory functions than do
multilingual subjects in everyday life.
Here, we used voxel-based morphometry (VBM), and
compared grey matter volumes between professional SIs and
multilingual control subjects within a-priori defined regions-
of-interest (ROI). Based on the functional-anatomical frame-
work proposed by Abutalebi and Green (2007) as well as on
previous neuroimaging studies performed with SIs (Elmer,
Hänggi, et al., 2011; Elmer, Meyer, et al., 2011; Rinne et al.,
2000), between-group comparisons were evaluated in the
following ROIs: inferior-lateral portion of the frontal opercu-
lum (pars triangularis and pars opercularis), middle-anterior
cingulate gyrus, caudate nucleus, middle-anterior insula,
SMG, and angular gyrus. Furthermore, in order to better
differentiate between training-related grey matter changes
and brain characteristics that were still present before
training, we performed correlative analyses between the cu-
mulative number of interpreting hours and grey matter vol-
ume in the a-priori selected ROIs.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Participants
In the present work, we measured 12 professional SIs (all
certified and graduated professional SI, eight women and four
men, mean age ¼ 37.9 years, standard deviation [SD] ¼ 5.8
years, age range 28e48, mean cumulative number of practice
hours ¼ 5080 h, SD ¼ 3505 h) and 12 multilingual control
subjects (eight women and four men, mean age ¼ 28.4 years,
SD ¼ 2.8 years, age range 25e38). None of the control subjects
grew up in a bilingual context, and all subjects reported to
speak at least three (2 subjects reported to speak 4 languages)

languages fluently (the language of the region, a second na-
tional language, and English). Age of language acquisition (AA)
and education time (ET) were estimated by taking into account
regional differences in the Swiss scholar system: GER (mother
tongue), FRE (AA w 8e11 years, ET w 8 years), ENG
(AA w 11e14 years, ET w 6 years), ITA (AA w 14 years, ET w 4
years), SPA (AAw 14 years, ETw 4 years), POR (AAw 14 years,
ET w 4 years). All other languages were acquired outside the
context of school after the age of w18e20 years.
All participants were consistent right-handers according to
Annett’s questionnaire (Annett, 1970), had a comparable level
of education (i.e., university degree or were advanced uni-
versity students), reported no past or current neurological,
psychiatric, or neuropsychological problems, and denied
illegal medication. Subjects were paid for participation, the
local ethics committee (Zurich, Switzerland) approved the
study and written informed consent was obtained from all
participants. Table 1 provides an overview of the autobio-
graphical data of the SIs investigated in the present study.
2.2. Imaging data acquisition
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired on a
3.0 T Philips Achieva whole body scanner (Philips Medical
Systems, Best, The Netherlands) equipped with a transmit-
receive body coil and a commercial eight-element sensitivity
encoding (SENSE) head coil array. A volumetric 3D T1-
weighted gradient echo sequence (TFE, turbo field echo)
image was measured with a spatial resolution of
1 1 1.5 mm (acquisition matrix 224 224 pixels, 180 slices)
and reconstructed to a resolution of .86  .86  .75 mm3
(reconstructed matrix 256  256 pixels, 180 slices). Further

testing took place at the same day. SI and control subjects
were measured in an interleaved manner.
2.3. VBM
Between-group differences in grey matter volume were eval-
uated by using VBM (Ashburner & Friston, 2000; Good,
Ashburner, & Frackowiak, 2001). All pre-processing steps
were performed with the VBM8 toolbox (release 435, http://
dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/vbm/download/) that uses Statistical
Parametric Mapping (SPM8, release 4667, http://www.fil.ion.
ucl.ac.uk/spm/) software. The following pre-processing steps
were realized: (1) the coordinate origin of each native image
was manually set on the anterior commissure. (2) Intensity
inhomogeneity (bias field) correction, tissue class segmenta-
tion, and spatial normalization (affine and warping) were
performed using unified segmentation (Ashburner & Friston,
2005) combined with SPM8’s “new segmentation approach”.
For spatial normalization, the diffeomorphic anatomical
registration using exponentiated lie algebra (DARTEL)
approach was used (Ashburner, 2007). Canonical a-priori
maps (ICBM 152 T1-weighted) implemented in SPM8 were
used as reference templates. (3) To enhance tissue class seg-
mentation, Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) modulation
was applied [(Cuadra, Cammoun, Butz, Cuisenaire, & Thiran,
2005), http://dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/vbm/markov-random-
fields/]. (4) To investigate absolute volumes, the warped im-
ages were voxel-wise multiplied with the Jacobian determi-
nant of the deformations (linear as well as nonlinear terms
were modulated). (5) The resulting Jacobian and HMRF
modulated and segmented GM images were smoothed with a
Gaussian kernel of full width at half maximum
(FWHM) ¼ 9 mm and the additional smoothing introduced
during the modulation process was about FWHM ¼ 3 mm.
2.4. Statistical analyses
Between-group comparisons were performed by using the
general linear model (GLM) that implements an unpaired
t-test in SPM8. Global GM volume was used as nuisance
variable in analyses of covariance of local GM volume.
Furthermore, since the two groups significantly differed in
age, this variable was implemented in the model as a co-
variate of no interest. Grey matter volume differences be-
tween the two groups were evaluated in a set of a-priori
defined bilateral ROIs, namely in the inferior-lateral portion
of the frontal operculum (pars triangularis and opercularis),
middle-anterior cingulate gyrus, caudate nucleus, supra-
marginal and angular gyrus, and in the middle-anterior
insula. All these ROIs were added into a single, composite
brain mask image and explicitly applied to restrict the sta-
tistical analysis to the voxels within this mask. The first five
ROIs were taken from the functional-anatomical framework
proposed by Abutalebi and Green (2007), and originated from
the HarvardeOxford cortical and subcortical structural
atlases as implemented in the FSL software package (http://
fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/Atlases). The insula was
selected based on previous neuroimaging studies performed
with SIs (Elmer, Hänggi, et al., 2011) and also originated from
the HarvardeOxford cortical structural atlas. All ROIs were
threshold at 30% probability. Since we had clear a-priori hy-
potheses, we used an uncorrected alpha error probability of
p < .005 and a voxel extent threshold of 25 voxels. In addition,
within the SIs group we performed linear regression analyses
between grey matter volume in each ROI and the cumulative
number of practice hours (corrected for the influence of age).
Linear regressions were performed by using the GLM that
implements the multiple regression in SPM8 (alpha error
probability of p < .01 and voxel extent threshold of 15 voxels,
uncorrected). Correlations were computed within a compos-
ite map of all ROIs as an explicit mask in SPM8. In addition,
for reasons of completeness and as suggested by one anon-
ymous reviewer, we performed explorative whole-brain
group comparisons using the GLM that implements an un-
paired t-test combined with the threshold-free cluster-
enhancement approach (Smith & Nichols, 2009) (alpha error
probability of p < .001, 5000 permutations, both FWE cor-
rected and uncorrected, see FWE value in Table 3). However,
since we did not have specific hypotheses concerning the
grey matter volume relying outside the above-mentioned
ROIs, the results of the whole-brain analysis are reported as

3. Results
Between-group comparisons revealed reduced grey matter
volume in SIs in the left middle-anterior cingulate gyrus,
bilateral middle-anterior insula, left SMG, bilateral pars tri-
angularis, and left pars opercularis. These anatomical results
are shown in Fig. 1 (left column, blue colour) and summarized
in Table 2. In addition, within the SIs group a correlative
analysis revealed a negative relationship between greymatter
volume and the cumulative number of practice hours in the
right pars opercularis, left pars triangularis, middle-anterior
cingulate gyrus, and left and right caudate (right column of
Fig. 1, red colour, and Table 3). The results of the whole-brain
analysis are reported as supplemental material (see
Supplemental Figure S1 and Supplemental Table S1).
4. Discussion
4.1. Grey matter architecture and plasticity in brain regions supporting cognitive aspects of language control
Meanwhile, it is widely accepted that cognitive functions
fundamentally contribute to control multiple language sys-
tems [for an overview consider (Abutalebi & Green, 2007)].
However, to date only few studies have investigated structural
neuroplasticity in brain regions supporting neurocognitional
aspects of language control as a function of training in
adulthood (Abutalebi et al., 2012; Elmer, Hänggi, et al., 2011;
Golestani, Price, & Scott, 2011). Therefore, in the present
work we compared grey matter volume between professional
SIs and multilingual control subjects in a-priori defined ROIs.
Results revealed reduced grey matter volumes in SIs,
compared to controls, in the left pars triangularis and oper-
cularis, right pars triangularis, left SMG, bilateral middle-
anterior cingulate gyrus, and in the bilateral middle-anterior
insula. Moreover, within the SIs group grey matter volume
in right pars opercularis, left pars triangularis, left middle-
anterior cingulate gyrus, and in the bilateral caudate nucleus
negatively correlated with the cumulative number of practice
hours. Since not all of the brain regions showing significant
group differences correlated with training parameters, results
are interpreted as indicating a composite of grey matter
characteristics that still persisted before training and training-
related changes. In turn, we will discuss these results in a
more comprehensive manner by focussing on each of the
single neuronal devices previously proposed to be implicated
in language control mechanisms in the multilingual brain
(Abutalebi & Green, 2007).
4.1.1. Middle-anterior cingulate gyrus The grey matter differences we revealed between the two
groups in the middle-anterior cingulate gyrus are compatible
with previous results showing functional (Abutalebi et al.,
2008, 2012; Luk et al., 2012) and structural changes in this
brain region in bilinguals compared to monolinguals
(Abutalebi et al., 2012; Zou, Ding, et al., 2012). Furthermore, in
a recent work Abutalebi and colleagues (Abutalebi et al., 2012)
reported reduced blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) re-
sponses in bilinguals compared to monolinguals during a
conflict monitoring task (i.e., flanker task) in a similar region
as we found, namely in the cognitive division of the cingulate
gyrus (Bush, Luu, & Posner, 2000). Interestingly, in the same
study the authors also found a relationship between conflict
effect during the flanker task (measured as the difference in
reaction time between incongruent and congruent trials) and
grey matter volume in the middle-anterior cingulate gyrus,
suggesting a contribution of this brain region to conflict
monitoring functions. However, Abutalebi and colleagues did
not reveal any structural between-group differences in the
cingulate gyrus between groups (Abutalebi et al., 2012).
Our results are relevant in that we provide evidence for the
fact that subjects extremely engaging cognitive control
mechanisms in everyday life are characterized by differential
grey matter architecture in the middle-anterior cingulate
gyrus. In addition, the architecture of this brain region was
related to the cumulative number of practice hours. Taking
into account the functionaleanatomical relationship reported
by Abutalebi et al. (2012) as well as the spatial location of the
cluster showing reduced grey matter in SIs, we may speculate
whether the anatomical changes we revealed have been, at
least partially, driven by the processingdemandsupon conflict
monitoring functions during translation. Certainly, the inten-
sive usage of other cognitive functions than conflict moni-
toring may likewise account for such grey matter changes in
SIs. In fact, the middle-anterior cingulate gyrus also mediates
error detection and attention functions (Bush et al., 2000), the
latter being for example necessary for monitoring both the
speech input and its respective translation (Elmer, 2013).
Certainly, further longitudinal studies combining behavioural,
functional, and anatomical measurements are required for
better comprehending the relationship between grey matter
changes, cognitive functions, and training.

4.1.2. Caudate nucleus A recent meta-analysis provided clear evidence for a bilateral
functional involvement of the caudate nucleus in bilinguals
during language switching (Luk et al., 2012). Currently, there is
even evidence showing functional (Abutalebi et al., 2013; van
Heuven, Schriefers, Dijkstra, & Hagoort, 2008) and structural
(Zou, Ding, et al., 2012) changes in this brain region in bi-
linguals compared to monolinguals. In addition, a recent im-
aging study could show that professional SIs are characterized
by a reduced fractional anisotropy in the head of the right
caudate nucleus compared to multilingual control subjects
(Elmer, Hänggi, et al., 2011). However, in the present work we
did not reveal structural between-group differences in the
caudate nuclei, possibly because of the rather small sample
size and the low statistical power. Nevertheless, within the SIs
group we found a negative relationship between grey matter
volume in the bilateral caudate nucleus and the cumulative
number of practice hours, suggesting a relationship between
grey matter characteristics and interpreting training. It is
important to mention that this result partially diverge from
that of a previous study by Zou and colleagues (Zou, Ding,
et al., 2012) who reported increased (and not decreased) grey
matter volume in the head of the left caudate in bilinguals
compared to monolinguals. However, bilinguals principally
differ from SIs in that the former more intensively practice
language control mechanisms during childhood, whereas the
latter acquire language-related cognitive skills as recently as
in adulthood. Therefore, we may speculate whether the pro-
cessing demands upon language control mechanisms may
differently affect grey matter volume depending on the
interaction between training onset and cortical development
(amore detailed discussion about this issue is implemented in
the section “Interpretation of reduced grey matter volume in
simultaneous interpreters”).
4.1.3. Pars triangularis Remarkably, we also found between-group differences in the
grey matter volume enclosing bilateral pars triangularis, a
brain region which comprises several histological sub-
divisions (Amunts et al., 2010, 1999) and has often been
associated (mainly in the left hemisphere) with syntactic
processing (Friederici & Gierhan, 2013; Gold & Buckner, 2002).
However, there is likewise evidence showing that language-
selective and domain-general regions lie side by side within
Broca’s area (Fedorenko, Duncan, & Kanwisher, 2012).
Consequently, this observation leads to suggest that the left
pars triangularis is not selective for language processing per
se, but more likely supports general cognitive functions. This
is compatible with the view that language switching, atten-
tion, and working memory tasks share, at least in part, the
same neuronal substrate (Fedorenko et al., 2012; Price et al.,
1999; Rodriguez-Fornells et al., 2002; Rogalsky & Hickok,
2011; Santi & Grodzinsky, 2012).
Interestingly, the grey matter differences we revealed be-
tween the two groups in pars triangularis were bilaterally
distributed and not restricted to the left hemisphere. In
addition, within the SIs group the left but not the right pars
triangularis was negatively correlated with the cumulative
number of interpreting practice hours. Hence, results are
interpreted as indicating that the left pars triangularis more
likely adapted as a function of training, probably for facili-
tating the intensive demands upon executive functions and/
or syntactic processing during interpreting, the latter being
indeed more strongly lateralized to the left hemisphere
(Herrmann, Obleser, Kalberlah, Haynes, & Friederici, 2012). In
contrast, since grey matter volume in the right pars train-
gularis was not at all related to practice parameters, we pro-
pose that this expert-specific architecture more likely reflects
differences that were still present before training and that
possibly may be advantageous for becoming professional SIs
rather than neuroplasticity per se.
4.1.4. SMG In the present work, we also revealed grey matter differences
between the two groups in the left SMG, a brain region situ-
ated in the IPL. In addition, within the SIs group grey matter
volume in the left SMG was negatively correlated with the
cumulative number of practice hours, suggesting a training-
related modulation of grey matter in this specific brain re-
gion. This result is in line with previous work showing struc-
tural changes in the IPL in bilinguals compared to
monolinguals (Della Rosa et al., 2013; Mechelli et al., 2004) as
well as with a previous fMRI study providing first evidence for
an increased responsiveness of the left IPL in SIs compared to
multilingual controls while performing an auditory attention
task (Elmer, Meyer, et al., 2011). Certainly, the IPL does not
only supports attention functions but also a variety of other
cognitive functions which are all strongly engaged during
simultaneous interpreting such as, for example, working
memory (Baldo & Dronkers, 2006; Buchsbaum et al., 2005;
Hickok, 2009) and phonetic processing (Golestani & Zatorre,
2004; Ruff et al., 2003; Turkeltaub & Coslett, 2010). In fact, for
performing simultaneous translations SIs have to perceive
and decode the phonetic structure of the input language, to
keep the meaning in working memory while formulating the
output in the target language, and to additionally allocate
attention resources, which are necessary for monitoring both
the speech input and its respective translational output
(Elmer, 2013).
4.2. Speech production, articulation, and sound-to-motor mapping mechanisms
A second main purpose of this study was to evaluated grey
matter architecture and plasticity in brain regions previously
proposed to be engaged in supporting speech production and
sensory-to-motor coupling mechanisms (Ackermann &
Riecker, 2010; Baldo et al., 2011; Dronkers, 1996; Elmer,
Hänggi, et al., 2011; Eickhoff et al., 2009; Golestani et al.,
2007; Golestani & Pallier, 2007; Mutschler et al., 2007). These
regions included the caudate nucleus, left pars opercularis,
and the left middle-anterior insula. Anatomically, the pars
opercularis is bounded by the inferior precentral sulcus, the
inferior frontal sulcus, and the ascending ramus of the Sylvian
fissure, and has previously been shown to support, among
other functions (Grodzinsky & Friederici, 2006; Heim, Opitz, &
Friederici, 2003), overt speech production (Eickhoff et al., 2009;
Richardson, Fillmore, Rorden, LaPointe, & Fridriksson, 2012).
From a histological perspective, this brain region has more
likely the characteristics of a motor than a sensory cortex
(Amunts et al., 1999; Anwander, Tittgemeyer, von Cramon,
Friederici, & Knosche, 2007; Kelly et al., 2010) because the
pars opercularis shows only a rudimentary developed cortical
layer IV. In addition, the pars opercularis (but not pars trian-
gularis) has been shown to be connected to the posterior and
middle superior temporal gyrus via the arcuate fasciculus, a
fibre bundle that is an important prerequisite for sensory-to-
motor transformations (Friederici & Gierhan, 2013). Mean-
while, there is likewise evidence showing that the caudate
nucleus (Eickhoff et al., 2009) and the left anterior insula
(Ackermann & Riecker, 2010; Dronkers, 1996; Eickhoff et al.,
2009) are important for supporting overt speech production
and articulation. Even though the insula is engaged in a vari-
ety of cognitive, emotional, and motor functions as well
(Kurth et al., 2010; Sterzer & Kleinschmidt, 2010), at least its
left middle-anterior part has been repeatedly shown to sup-
port overt speech, articulation, phonation, as well as to be
engaged in the regulation of ventilation during speech pro-
duction (Ackermann & Riecker, 2010; Baldo et al., 2011;
Dronkers, 1996). In addition, the insula has been reported in
association with sensory-to-motor transformations
(Mutschler et al., 2007, 2009). Such transformations are for
example necessary for coupling phonetic representations
with articulation. In line with our hypothesis, we provide ev-
idence for expertise-dependent grey matter architecture in
the left and right insula and in the left pars opercularis. Grey
matter volume in these regions did not correlate with training
parameters. Furthermore, grey matter volume in the right
pars opercularis and in the bilateral caudate nucleus inversely
correlated with the cumulative number of practice hours,
leading to suggest training-related plastic adaptations.
4.3. Interpretation of reduced grey matter volume in SI
In the present work, we consistently revealed reduced grey
matter volumes in SIs compared to multilingual control sub-
jects. By contrast, most of the previous studies that investi-
gated language expertise revealed increased grey matter
volumes in bilinguals compared to monolinguals (Della Rosa
et al., 2013; Mechelli et al., 2004; Zou, Ding, et al., 2012).
Although this divergence of results seems contra intuitive, it is
important to mention that a main biographical difference
between bilinguals and SIs is that the former still train exec-
utive control during childhood, whereas in the latter group the
demands upon cognitive control mechanisms principally
emerge and increase during early adulthood. Meanwhile, it is
generally acknowledged that brain maturation until early
adolescence is associated with increased grey matter volume,
whereas during adulthood cortical grey matter is influenced
by synaptic “pruning” and decreases in order to promote
functional specialization (Giorgio et al., 2010; Gogtay et al.,
2004; Paus, 2005). Therefore, we may speculate whether the
training of languages-related skills during childhood may
additionally increase grey matter volume. Consequently,
more nerve cells will survive pruning, resulting in increased
grey matter volume when comparing bilinguals and mono-
linguals during adulthood by using cross-sectional ap-
proaches. In contrast, by considering cortical pruning as a
process of removing inefficient nerve cells, we may speculate
whether the intense training of language control in early
adulthood may additionally promote pruning in adulthood
and therefore improve functional specialization, leading to
more efficient processing (Kanai & Rees, 2011). This reasoning
further implies that the grey matter architecture underlying
language expertise and control can fundamentally diverge
depending on the time of acquisition of specific skills during
different periods of cortical development. Finally, it should
also be mentioned that the training of specific skills is not
always associated with increased grey matter volume (James,
Oechslin, Van De Ville, Descloux, & Lazeyras, 2013; Takeuchi
et al., 2011). In fact, there is growing evidence from longitu-
dinal studies showing that grey matter volume can decrease
as a function of cognitive training. For example, Takeuchi and
colleagues (Takeuchi et al., 2011) showed that after intensive
working memory training grey matter volume bilaterally
decreased in frontal and parietal regions in a sample of young
adults.
5. Limitations
Here, we evaluated grey matter differences between profes-
sional SIs andmultilingual controls. Thereby, we only focused
on brain anatomy (and not function) in a set of a-priori defined
ROIs. Consequently, it results difficult to draw accurate con-
clusions about structureefunction relationships. A further
shortcoming of the present work is that we dissociated
training-related changes and training-unrelated differences
based on correlative analyses. However, it is definitely
possible that some between-group differenceswere attributed
to grey matter differences that were still present before
interpreting training instead of plastic changes. For example it
has been shown that anatomical constraint in mesiotemporal
brain areas are most important in determining improvement
of cognitive functions after practising (Supekar et al., 2013).
This may be related to the fact that our sample, and therefore
the statistical power, was rather small. Furthermore, future
studies comparing professional SIs and bilinguals as well as
longitudinal studies may provide important information for
better comprehending how the training of language-related
skills may influence grey matter architecture during
different periods of cortical development. A further short-
coming of the present work is that the paradigmwe used does
not enable to assess whether interpreting training addition-
ally drives grey matter plasticity in regions that are already
modulated by multilingualisms or rather shapes the archi-
tecture of additional brain regions. Further studies comparing
multilinguals, monolinguals, and SIs may constitute a fruitful
approach for better comprehending this issue. Finally, we
want to emphasize that even though the subjects who
participated in the present study reported to fluently speak
the foreign languages in a conversational context, we cannot
exclude that some differences in linguistic skills may have
influenced the data in some direction.
6. Conclusions
Our results provide first evidence for an expertise-specific grey
matter architecture in professional SIs which is assumed to be
driven by the cognitive, linguistic and articulatory re-
quirements necessary for simultaneously translating a source
language into a target language during adulthood.
